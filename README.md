# brrmod
Roblox modification tool, coded in Python.

This allows you to change a couple of roblox files automatically.

You can change:
- Death sound effect
- Ingame cursor
- Ingame watermark (Synapse,Script-ware)

P.s: typing "Default" just wont change any files, so any previous mods will stay when you type it.
